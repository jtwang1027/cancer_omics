biological motivation


This challenge involves analysis of the largest single cell signaling dataset (67 cancer cell lines). The motivation is to understand the heterogenous, time-dependent responses to multiple drug treatments. In understanding single-cell and cancer line responses to treatments, we aim to predict responses to drug candidates.
